## Amadou + Saltpetre:
Saltpetre (potassium nitrate) wasn't a primary ancient firestarter for making the initial spark, but ancient peoples, especially Vikings, used it to enhance tinder, like touchwood fungus, by soaking it in urine to create a slow-smoldering, easily transportable ember, crucial for survival in damp conditions. Saltpetre's main fire-related role came later in gunpowder (with charcoal/sulfur), but its presence in ancient fire-starting shows early chemical ingenuity, with natural deposits gathered from caves (like bat guano) or produced from manure/urine mixtures in "nitraries". 
Ancient Uses & Production:
Viking "Touchwood": Vikings soaked Fomes fomentarius fungus in urine to create a treated tinder that would smolder for hours when sparked by flint, allowing them to carry fire across seas.
Natural Deposits: Saltpetre (potassium nitrate) forms naturally from decaying organic matter, found in caves (bat guano) or on old walls where manure was present.
Ancient Knowledge: While Romans knew saltpetre (for cooking/curing), they likely didn't grasp its combustible qualities for explosives; Chinese texts mention it earlier for fire. 
How it Worked (for Smoldering):
Urine (containing ammonia/nitrates) and decaying organic matter (manure, soil) created a nitrogen-rich environment.
Bacteria converted ammonia to nitrates, which, when leached and concentrated, formed saltpetre.
This treated fungus/material would catch a spark and glow (smolder) rather than immediately flare up, preserving the ember. 

## More on Amadou:

The internal flesh of fomes fomentarious is very useful. Called amadou, if can be used as tinder for starting fires (think flint and steel), can be made into hats and clothes, is the absolute best material for drying your fishing flies, and has medicinal properties (can brew tea from it and there is slight anti-septic properties making it a great emergency wound dressing). Amadou is the brown felt-like layer (not really felt but closest thing I can think of) just between the exterior skin and spore tubules. It’s quite hard when you first cut it away, but becomes softer as you work it, you can tenderize it by hitting it with a smooth rock. You can also boil it in water with a bit of wood ash and that’ll soften it up for use too. If using it for tinder, a trick I like to use is boil the amadou with saltpetre (potassium nitrate) and it becomes a quick-strike tinder-sparkler great at starting your camp fires.

Also called Hoof Fungus - may want to rename 

## Birch Polypore:

Tea and tincture mostly. But also as a firestarter sometimes.

It has long been known that the Birch Polypore has medicinal uses, it has been used as a tonic for the immune system, as an antiseptic to clean wounds and promote healing, a plaster that is microporus, antifungal and antiseptic and probably was used by Bronze Age man to get rid of parasitic worms.

Another possible use of the fungus by Bronze Age man was as a very good tinder that can be started with a weak spark or used to transport fire as the fungus can smoulder for a long time and can be used to take to the next camp or destination and get a fire lit quickly without the long and laborious task of lighting a fire by friction.
Birch trees contain betulinic acid which has many health benefits, there are also other chemicals in the Birch Polypore that are beneficial for being healthy. With modern research it is becoming clear that the Birch Polypore is an important mushroom to look into, tests have been carried out and so far found the following.

Antiviral. In tests extracts from the Birch Polypore blocked reproduction in HIV cells, attacked and incapacitated encephalitis infections and has proved positive in treating flu, yellow fever and West Nile flu.

Antibiotic. The Birch Polypore contains the antibiotic piptamine which has been used to treat e-coli.

Anti inflammatory. There are several triterpene acids present and these are known anti-inflammatory substances.

Anti Tumor. Betulinic acid and other chemicals in the fungi have been shown to cause apoptosis, the destruction of cancer cells while not affecting healthy cells.

Antiseptic. For cleaning wounds and being an aid to healing.

Antifungal. This mushroom does not like to share its habitat with other mushrooms and contains some powerful antifungals.

Styptic. The fungus has styptic properties (it staunches bleeding).

The mushroom has very beneficial effects on the immune system and many people drink a tea made from the fresh or dried fungi and swear by its positive effects.

It is considered inedible,[20] except potentially when young.[21]

## Rose Hips:

Rose hips are the vibrant, edible fruit of the rose plant, packed with Vitamin C and antioxidants, used in teas, jams, syrups, and traditional remedies for immune support and inflammation, though they must be prepared carefully to remove irritating inner hairs and seeds

Abundant - should maybe not yield in typical foraging? Only in pine areas could be harvestable

## Willow Bark 

Willow bark, sourced from various species of willow trees, contains a compound called salicin, which the body converts into salicylic acid—the active ingredient in aspirin. It has been used for thousands of years as a traditional remedy for pain and inflammation. 
Key Uses and Benefits
Clinical studies suggest willow bark may be effective for: 
Low back pain: Several well-designed studies have found that willow bark extract can provide significant relief for chronic low back pain, particularly at higher doses of salicin (240 mg daily).
Osteoarthritis: Some evidence suggests it may reduce pain from osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, though study results have been mixed.
Headaches: Willow bark has been shown to help relieve headaches.
Other traditional uses: Herbalists may also recommend it for menstrual cramps, fever, flu symptoms, and various inflammatory conditions like bursitis and tendinitis, though more research is needed for these uses. 
Forms and Dosage
Willow bark is available in several forms, including: 
Capsules and tablets: These offer a convenient way to get a standardized dose of salicin.
Teas/Decoctions: The dried bark can be simmered in water to make a bitter-tasting tea.
Liquid extracts/Tinctures: These can be added to water or juice and may be absorbed faster than capsules.
Topical creams and ointments: For targeted relief of sore muscles and joints. 

Like pine needles - may not make sense to turn up in random foraging - should probably be a Willow tree harvestable that is somewhat rare to find it since it's the strongest painkiller.

## Puffball Mushroom (new?)

Puffballs (Lycoperdon, Calvatia species) — These are probably your best bet for "commonly eaten." They grow in grasslands and forest margins, would have thrived in the mammoth steppe edges, are unmistakable when young (solid white interior), and provide decent calories. Modern subarctic foragers still prize them. They're also one of the few mushrooms that dry well for storage.
